# Drugs_ICER
Here, I used a drugs dataset from Kaggle.com and performed a full ICER calculation on it. I compared ICER for 101 drugs used in hypertension.
Verapamil had the highest customer satisfaction score; however, it did not have the best price. I calculated ICER scores to find the best substitute.
The conclusion is that Eprosartan is the best drug to be replaced with Verapamil. I used ChatGPT's help in this code.
